### Dataset Description

The `early_january_weather` dataset contains hourly meteorological data
for LGA, JFK and EWR for the month of January 2013. It has 358 rows and
15 columns. The mean temperature during this period was 39.6 F.

Important variables include `origin` (weather station),
`year, month, day, hour` (time of recording), `temp` (temperature in F),
`dewp` (dew point in F), `humid` (relative humidity), `wind_dir` (wind
direction in degrees), `wind_speed` (wind speed in mph), `wind_gust`
(wind gust speed in mph) `precip` (precipitation in inches),
`pressure`(sea level pressure in millibars) `visib` (visibility in
miles),`time_hour`(Date and hour of the recording as a POSIXct date).

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(
    title = "Temperature over Time",
    x = "Time",
    y = "Temperature (F)",
    color = "Humidity (%)"
  ) 
```

### Scatterplot description

The scatterplot shows that temperature generally increased over the two
weeks, with some fluctuations.Humidity tends to be higher at lower
temperatures and lower at higher temperatures.
